                    simple. We need to care, or nothing else matters.

                            crime because of some extortion racket the second
                            they roll into town. If Pine Ridge has a population

                                said, “and if you need anything — advice,

                            Innkeeper —oddball, typical small town yokel, or
                            super sus?

                                Noelan chuckled and exchanged a glance with
                                Lawson. “No jail. Not yet.”

                                Relief softened Bennet’s face. Bound hands rose

                                make tracks?”

                                “Not so fast.” Lawson twisted in his seat to
                                look back at him. “How exactly are you planning
                                on getting that money?”

                                Noelan didn’t say anything and simply glared at

                Remember why you became an English teacher? It was for the
                magic. The "click" of understanding in a student's eyes. The
                thrill of a classroom debate so electric you don't want the bell
                to ring. The pride of reading a student essay that is sharp,
                clear, and powerful.

                But the daily reality can feel... different. You're fighting for
                attention against a firehose of digital distraction. And you're
                often doing it with one hand tied behind your back by a
                curriculum of "classic" texts that are, let's be honest, a tough
                sell.

                What if the magic wasn't the exception? What if it was the
                everyday standard?

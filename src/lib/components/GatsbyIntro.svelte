            The Irrelevance of "Greatness"

                For years, we've told students *The Great Gatsby* is a
                masterpiece. We have presented it as the summit of American
                prose.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Then we send them home, alone with the book. But unlike truly
                challenging modernists like Faulkner or Joyce, whose complex
                prose still follows a masterful internal logic, what students
                find in *Gatsby* is different. They find writing that violates
                the fundamental principles of craft they have learned in every
                other context.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The mental gymnastics and nuance required to navigate your
                average 16 year old student through the pedagogical nightmare
                literally never happens.

                    Instead what always happens is they are told to read this
                    “great” book. They find sentences that are <strong
                        >technically unsound</strong
                    >. They encounter poetic sounding phrases that are logically
                    fraudulent. They see a narrative engine that is mechanically
                    broken.

                If you tell them this is great they will subconsciously try to
                imitate it. When that happens, it’s a disaster for the student.

            The Problem with "Accuracy"

                We tell them they are about to read the sharpest, funniest, most
                savage satire in Western literature. We promise them a book that
                toppled empires and mocked kings.

                Then we hand them a standard translation. And the room goes
                silent.

                They don’t see a revolution; they see a history textbook. They
                don’t hear a razor-sharp wit; they hear the dry scratching of a
                quill. They read the words, but they miss the point.

                    The War: Letter vs. Spirit
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In the world of translation, there is a war between the
                    "Letter" (literal word-for-word accuracy) and the "Spirit"
                    (the intended emotional and intellectual effect).

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Standard academic translations are obsessed with the Letter.
                    They are faithful to the vocabulary, but they betray the
                    Author. By prioritizing 18th-century sentence structures and
                    obscure cultural references, they murder the one thing that
                    makes Candide work: <span class="font-bold text-yellow-600"

                        A joke that has to be explained in a footnote is not a
                        joke; it is an autopsy.

                If your students aren't laughing, they aren't actually reading
                Candide. They are reading a lifeless transcript of what used to
                be a funny book.
